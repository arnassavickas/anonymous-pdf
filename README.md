# LETTERHEAD.pdf
LETTERHEAD.pdf is an easy-to-use app for applying a letterhead to your pdf files. Just drag your single or multiple page file(s), and instantly receive a pdf with your beautiful letterhead applied! 

## Usage
Replace `header.pdf`  and  `footer.pdf` in `/src` folder with your files and and then run:

     git clone https://github.com/arnassavickas/letterhead-pdf.git
     cd letterhead-pdf
     npm install
     npm run

If everything works to your desire, you can `npm run build` in the terminal and simply host the files on any shared hosting.
## Motivation
I was working in a company where the invoices were created without any letterhead and manually applying it every time with a PDF editor was too bothersome. So I have spent a weekend creating LETTERHEAD.pdf and that made me and my colleagues just a little bit happier.
